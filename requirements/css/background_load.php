Dear MrLive,
Don't worry.  This file has not been changed.  The new theming of the sites are controlled by the dark_theme and light_theme scripts.  
If you ever want to revert to the Windows 9x-style, just add this script back into the imports.

Hope this helps,
MINDtek

Oh thanks for letting me know!

It helped! Many Thanks, MrLive.
